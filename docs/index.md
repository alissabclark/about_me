# About Me
I'm a technical writer based out of Denver, Colorado. In my career, I've regularly interfaced with Product, Engineering, QA, Training, and Customer Support/Operations organizations. It's always been my pleasure (and challenge!) to ensure that every deliverable I write is understandable and consumable to the targeted audience.  

See [some of my documentation adapted for GitBook](https://alissa-b-clark.gitbook.io/portfolio-and-examples/).

And you can see some of my previous published work here:

- [Creating and Using OracleÂ® Solaris Kernel Zones](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E36784_01/html/E37629/index.html)
- [Using Unified Archives for System Recovery and Cloning in Oracle Solaris 11.2](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E36784_01/html/E38524/index.html)
